# Comparative Analysis of Lung Texture in High Resolution CT Images
A Computed Tomography (CT) is a medical technique that uses x-rays to produce detailed images from the interior of the body. In this repository, there are several files that help the studying and comparation of  lung textures from a control group and from patients with enphysema, using High Resolution CT images. There is the need of having a MatLab account.

# Hardware Components
The only hardware component needed is a computer.

# Working Principle
When the main code 'FinalProject.m' is executed, it will extract all the images from the 'dataROI_E_N.mat' file and will use all the remain files to extract several characteristics belonging to each class of patient analysed: normal patient and emphysema patient. 

# Report
The file named 'Comparative_Analysis_of_Lung_Texture_in_HR_CT_Images.pdf' represents the report written about this study, where can be found all the methods and results used.
